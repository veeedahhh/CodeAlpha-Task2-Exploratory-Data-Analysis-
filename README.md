# CodeAlpha-Task2-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-

## Overview
This task involved me exploring and understanding a dataset using Python.It involved me performing data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization on the datsets to uncover trends and patterns.

## Objectives of this Project:
1.To explore data structure and summary statistics.
2.To identify trends, patterns, and outliers.
3.To test relationships between variables.
4.And also to detect potential data quality issues.

## Tools & Libraries Used
1. **Python 3**
2. **Pandas**
3. **Matplotlib**
4. **Seaborn**
5. **JupyterLab**

## Steps Performed
1. I loaded the **Titanic dataset (`titanic.csv`)** from Kaggle using Pandas.
2. I inspected data types, missing values, and summary statistics.
3. I visualized passenger survival counts by gender and class.
4. I also checked distributions of age, fare, and other features.
5. And finally I created correlation plots and boxplots for deeper analysis.

## Key Observations
1. Female passengers had a higher survival rate.
2. First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
3. Age and Fare showed moderate correlation with survival.

## Charts/Visualisations:
1. Bar chart: Survival by Gender  
2. Bar chart: Survival by Passenger Class  
3. Histogram: Age distribution  

The `csv` file used in this analysis is in the repository.
